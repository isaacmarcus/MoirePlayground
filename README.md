# Moire Playground

A WebApp built on Flutter exploring the concept of "moire". What is traditionally looked and seen as something to avoid
or something to remove from photos/art, can now be created easily using this. I explore the use of responsive design of containers to create 
an experience where the user gets to play around with and create designs exhibit "moire".
