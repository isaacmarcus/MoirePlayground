# Moire Playground

A WebApp built on Flutter exploring the concept of "moire". What is traditionally looked and seen as something to avoid
or something to remove from photos/art, can now be created easily using this.

## Getting Started

Head over to https://isaacmarcus.github.io/MoirePlayground/ to get started

You'll be greeted with a base Moire Box, of which you can change the properties to achieve a desired shape/size.
